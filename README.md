# Blog-Projects
In this Github repository, I will upload all those projects that I taught, shared or explained on my blog. The link for my blog page is https://originalcodingcult.blogspot.com/. On my blog I post stuff about coding, AI and projects that I feel are worth sharing. Here is, all the code in those blogs. If there is any project or suggestion for me, please write it in the respective comment section of the blog. Since all my projects are open source, you guys can and probably will catch some bugs and throw them at me. Please do throw them at me, but just politiely. I will try to solve and debug my code and will let you know once the code is bug-free. 

Please support me by following my blog and by commenting your views on any blog. You can write me by email, which I believe you can find after a bit of hardwork. Happy Programming :D
